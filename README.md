# Layouting

# In this project I created a webpage for a car.

# There is some text, some images and a video in my project.

# Using CSS I customize the displayed text and background along with the images that needed to be moved so that you have images on top of other features rather than below or above.

# It is best to zoom out to 80% to see the whole website in a window
